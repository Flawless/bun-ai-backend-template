# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records that document the key architectural decisions made for this project, including the context, options considered, and rationale behind each decision.

## Purpose

ADRs serve to:

- Document architectural decisions with their reasoning
- Provide historical context for future developers
- Make implicit knowledge explicit
- Enable better decision-making by learning from past choices
- Facilitate architectural reviews and discussions

## What Belongs Here

- **Technology Choices**: Framework, database, language decisions
- **Architectural Patterns**: How components interact and are organized
- **Infrastructure Decisions**: Deployment, scaling, monitoring approaches
- **Integration Approaches**: How external systems are integrated
- **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Development Practices**: Testing strategies, code organization

## Naming Convention

ADRs should be numbered sequentially and use descriptive titles:

- `001-use-typescript-with-bun.md`
- `002-adopt-testing-trophy-philosophy.md`
- `003-implement-structured-logging.md`

## Template

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft for discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision has been made and implementation can begin
3. **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but still in use
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (reference the new ADR)
