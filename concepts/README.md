# Concepts Documentation

This directory contains high-level conceptual documentation that describes the fundamental ideas, principles, and approaches of the system without diving into specific technical implementations.

## Purpose

Concepts documentation serves to:

- Define the core business domain and problem space
- Establish fundamental principles and design philosophies
- Describe user workflows and system behaviors at a high level
- Provide context for architectural decisions without implementation details

## What Belongs Here

- **Domain Models**: Core business concepts and their relationships
- **System Principles**: Fundamental rules that guide all decisions
- **User Workflows**: How users interact with the system
- **Quality Attributes**: Performance, security, scalability requirements
- **Constraints**: Business, regulatory, or organizational limitations

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Specific technology choices (use ADRs for that)
- Implementation details or code examples
- Step-by-step technical procedures (use Tasks for that)
- Database schemas or API specifications
